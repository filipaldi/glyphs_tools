# Core Requirements:
Create a new Glyphs file programmatically for each grid point
Set up a single master with specific interpolation values
Copy all glyphs from the original font
Save as separate .glyphs files

# Implementation Steps:
Create a new GSFont object for each grid point
Copy font metadata (family name, etc.) from the original
Create a single master with specific axis values based on grid coordinates
Copy all glyphs from the source font to the new font
Save the new font to a .glyphs file with a descriptive name
Implement batching/pausing for performance management

# Technical Challenges:
Creating a proper master with correct interpolation values
Ensuring all necessary font features are copied
Managing memory usage when creating many Glyphs files
Copying OpenType features and other metadata correctly
The code structure would be similar to your batch_exporter.py, but instead of exporting font files, it would create and save new .glyphs files with single masters at specific interpolation positions.
