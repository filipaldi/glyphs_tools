Glyphs Interpolator

It is a tool that allows interpolation between multiple glyph files like UFOs.

Normaly Glyphs interpolate only masters within the a file which in extensive system of masters becomes unmanageable.

Therefore the UFO like strategy provides an approach to split masters of one Glyphs file in separate files and interpolate between them.
